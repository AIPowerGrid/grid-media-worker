# ComfyUI Bridge Workflow Templates

> **Adding a NEW model? Don't start here.** These `_bridge` workflow templates are
> the legacy worker-side path. New image/video models are added as **governed recipes**
> in grid-core — see `grid-core/docs/architecture/RECIPE_DISPATCH.md`. The recipe flow
> auto-detects the node map for you and adds clamp/enum governance the `_bridge` format
> never had. This file is kept only for the models still on the legacy path.

This directory contains workflow templates for the ComfyUI Bridge. Each workflow file is a JSON representation of a ComfyUI workflow.

## How to Use

1. Create a JSON file with your ComfyUI workflow
2. Use placeholder values that will be replaced by the bridge:
   - `POSITIVE_PROMPT_PLACEHOLDER` - Will be replaced with the user's prompt
   - `NEGATIVE_PROMPT_PLACEHOLDER` - Will be replaced with the user's negative prompt
3. Run the bridge with your selected workflow file:
   ```
   python start_bridge.py --workflow your_workflow.json
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can set the workflow file in your `.env` file:
   ```
   WORKFLOW_FILE=your_workflow.json
   ```

## Dynamic Values

The bridge will automatically update the following values in your workflow:

- `seed` - Replaced with the job's seed value
- `steps` - Replaced with the job's steps value
- `cfg` - Replaced with the job's CFG scale value
- `sampler_name` - Replaced with the job's sampler name (mapped to ComfyUI compatibility)
- `width` and `height` - Replaced with the job's requested dimensions
- `filename_prefix` - Replaced with a job-specific ID for the output file

## Available Workflow Templates

The repository includes several pre-made templates:

- `sd15_workflow.json` - For Stable Diffusion 1.5
- `sdxl_workflow.json` - For SDXL Base 1.0
- `sdxl_turbo_workflow.json` - For SDXL Turbo (optimized parameters)
- `turbovision.json` - For TurboVision XL
- `sdxl-lightning.json` - For SDXL Lightning

## How to Get a Workflow File

1. Create your workflow in ComfyUI
2. Click the "Save" button to download the workflow as a JSON file
3. Copy the JSON file to this directory
4. Run the bridge with your selected workflow

## Special Node Requirements

For the bridge to properly update your workflow, it should contain:

1. A `KSampler` node (for updating sampling parameters)
2. `CLIPTextEncode` nodes with the placeholders mentioned above
3. An `EmptyLatentImage` node (for setting dimensions)
4. A `SaveImage` node (for saving the output with the correct filename)

The bridge will try to find these nodes by their class type, regardless of the node IDs used in your workflow.
