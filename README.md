# ComfyUI Bridge for AI Power Grid

Connect your local ComfyUI installation to the AI Power Grid network and run it as a distributed image generation worker.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- **Bridge**: Receives image-generation jobs from AI Power Grid.  
- **Worker**: Executes jobs via your local ComfyUI instance.  
- **Return**: Uploads generated images back to the network.  

This allows you to contribute GPU cycles to a decentralized AI rendering network while leveraging your local ComfyUI setup.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Auto-detects installed ComfyUI model checkpoints and maps them to AI Power Grid model names.  
- Customizable: override advertised models via `GRID_MODEL` (supports comma-separated lists).  
- Workflow templating: use your own ComfyUI `.json` workflow files.  
- Persistent WebSocket dispatch with streamed progress and presigned uploads.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.9+**  
2. **ComfyUI** running locally (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8188`).  
3. **AI Power Grid** account + API key from the [developer console](https://console.aipowergrid.io/dashboard/api-key).

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/grid-media-worker.git
cd grid-media-worker

# 2. Create & activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -e .
````

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy the example `.env` and adjust values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```ini
# .env
GRID_API_KEY=your_powergrid_api_key          # required
GRID_WORKER_NAME=MyComfyWorker               # optional
COMFYUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8188            # optional
GRID_API_URL=https://api.aipowergrid.io      # optional
GRID_WS=true                                 # required current transport
GRID_NSFW=false                              # allow NSFW? true/false
GRID_THREADS=2                               # concurrent jobs
GRID_MAX_PIXELS=1048576                      # max output resolution (pixels)
GRID_MODEL=stable_diffusion, Flux.1-Krea-dev Uncensored (fp8+CLIP+VAE)  # comma-separated model names
WORKFLOW_FILE=my_workflow.json               # ComfyUI JSON export template
```

* **`GRID_MODEL`** supports one or more model keys (comma-separated). If unset, the bridge auto-detects from your ComfyUI checkpoints.
* **`WORKFLOW_FILE`** points to a JSON workflow in your `workflows/` directory.

## ▶️ Running the Bridge

Start your ComfyUI web server, then:

```bash
comfy-bridge
```

The bridge will:

1. Register as a worker with AI Power Grid.
2. Receive jobs over the Grid worker WebSocket.
3. Render in ComfyUI.
4. Submit results back to the network.

## 🐳 Docker

### Build & Run the Container

1. **Build** the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t comfy-bridge .
   ```

2. **Run** the container:

   - **Linux** (host networking):
     ```bash
     docker run --rm --network host --env-file .env comfy-bridge
     ```

   - **macOS/Windows** (using `host.docker.internal`):
     ```bash
     docker run --rm \
       -v "$(pwd)/workflows:/app/workflows" \
       --env-file .env \
       -e COMFYUI_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8188 \
       comfy-bridge
     ```

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose

### If you prefer using Docker Compose to run your Container

**Linux**

Build & run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.linux.yml up --build
   ```

**macOS/Windows**

Build & run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.win-macos.yml up --build
   ```

---

## ✅ Testing

All core modules include unit and async tests. To run them:

```bash
pytest
```

Tests use `pytest-asyncio` for async routines and `respx` for HTTP mocking.

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

* **No jobs found?** Check `Advertising models:` log; ensure `GRID_MODEL` is set or your checkpoints match default mappings.
* **400 Bad Request**: unrecognized models—verify model key names or adjust `GRID_MODEL`.
* **ComfyUI unreachable**: confirm `COMFYUI_URL` and that the server is running.
* **API auth errors**: verify `GRID_API_KEY` and network access.

Logs are printed at INFO (bridge flow) and DEBUG (detailed payloads) levels. Adjust via:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
